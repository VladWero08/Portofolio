                    Hello, my name is Olaeriu Vlad and I'm a final-year Computer Science student who's into coding, volleyball, and sports in general. üèê 
                    I used to play volleyball during middle and high school, and I still love to do it. <br/><br></br>
                    Besides tech stuff, I love drawing and jamming to music. ‚úèÔ∏èüé∂ Because I love drawing, I have
                    a little passion for graphic design, I usually build logos or design small sections of websites.
                </p>
