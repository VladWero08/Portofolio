# ðŸ“– Portofolio

This repository is the final project for the course named **Advanced Front-End with React/Angular**, taken in my *3rd year* at the *Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest*. I have chose to use React, which will run in a docker orchestration with a *small FastAPI backend server* and a *MariaDB database*. This project is showcasing my personal portofolio, with links to some of my other projects that I have on my GitHub account, with informations about my education and professional experience and contact details.

## ðŸ”§ Prequisites

To be able to run the project, you would need to have installed the *docker engine* and *docker-compose* orchestration tool. Afterwards, you need to configure each *.env.sample* (inside */* and */backend*) file with your own data, and be careful that the *.env* information is matching.

## ðŸ’» React concepts

In the development of this application, several key React concepts have been employed to create a dynamic and efficient user experience. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the React concepts incorporated into this project, showcasing the innovative and responsive nature of the application.

- **Components**
- **State and Props**
- **Hooks**
- **Context API**: used for sharing a cookie received upon logging in between all the components
- **React Router**: incorporated React Router for navigation, enabling a single-page application experience
- **Private Routes**: the route that showcases my projects is private, you need to log-in in order to access it
- **Forms and Controlled Components**: used forms for logging in and registering
